# Quick Sort Algorithm

## Project Aims
To continue with my introduction to working with Java and sorting algorithms. This was the third preliminary project to the SortManager project (https://github.com/sgrill1/SortManager).  

## How It Works
The quick sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. It moves other items to the appropriate side of the list, either less than or greater than the pivot value, up to the point where the incrementors cross, at which point everything should be in order.
